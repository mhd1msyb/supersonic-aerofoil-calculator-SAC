# Supersonic Aerofoil Calculator - SAC


## Description

Cross-platform interactive flow calculator for aerofoil geometries. Cross-sections are constructed in 2D pixel coordinates, by either using a touchscreen or LMB on a mouse, to add nodal points (which define line segments) which form the outline mesh. The resulting arefoil can then by siimulated to have a variable angle of attack (AoA), and oblique shocks (OS) and expsansion fans (EF) are caulcted for every segment and redered using colour-coded primitives (lines for OS, tranagles for ES). Plots can be generated for common coefficients, namely cL and cD, for user-defined inlet flow conditions flow speed and gas gamma. The cross-section can be visualised in 3D as a single hollow blade/wing, or a set of instanced blades arranged around the hub of a turbine
